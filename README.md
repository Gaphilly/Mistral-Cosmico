# üå¶Ô∏è Mistral C√≥smico

A web application that predicts the weather for any specific date and location in the world, using historical climate data from NASA GES DISC.

## Project Overview

* This project was created to help users plan events, trips, or activities by providing an estimate of future weather conditions based on patterns from past data. The website combines an intuitive interface with scientific datasets to make weather prediction accessible to everyone.

## Features

* Global coverage: Select any place on Earth using an interactive map or a search bar.
* Date-based prediction: Choose a specific date to view estimated conditions.
* Historical data analysis: Uses NASA GES DISC datasets to infer weather trends.
* Detailed results: Displays predicted temperature, precipitation, and wind information.
* Simple interface: Designed to be easy to use and visually clear.

## How It Works

* The user selects a location on the map or enters it in the search bar.
* The system retrieves the GPS coordinates of that location.
* The backend fetches relevant historical climate data from the NASA GES DISC API.
* A prediction algorithm estimates likely conditions for the selected date.
* The website displays the results in a clean and interactive format.
